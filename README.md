[Description (single paragraph)]
The opioid epidemic is a complex public health crisis that disproportionately affects diverse populations across the United States. In Missouri, over 70% of drug overdose deaths in 2022 involved opioids.1 Pharmacological treatments are effective for lowering the risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) based on trial results. However, OUD treatments are highly underutilized with limited real-world evidence. This study aims to compare the real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments (i.e., methadone vs. buprenorphine) on the risk of severe opioid-related emergency department (ED) and inpatient visits among patients with OUD.
